Godot port of the tutorials at https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/ from "Building a Graph" to "Compute Shaders". The compute shaders part cannot be implemented like in Unity due to Godot currently not supporting porcedural geometry generation in the GPU nor a way to use a compute shader's buffer from another shader.
